## Text-classification-with-Transformer
This project implements a text classification model using Transformer-based architectures. The model is designed to efficiently classify text into predefined categories with high accuracy, leveraging the power of modern NLP techniques.
### Features
Utilizes Transformer models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for high-performance text classification.  

Fine-tuned on a custom dataset for optimal results.  

Implements tokenization and preprocessing pipelines.

Supports multi-class classification.

Easy to adapt to other text classification tasks.

### Future Work
Improve performance using larger Transformer models.

Experiment with different datasets and fine-tuning techniques.

Deploy the model as an API for real-world use cases.
